**KASIMIR UND KAROLINE**

*Paulin gets his actors to act with a solaced authenticity,*  
*and has a unique talent to create intensity and atmosphere*  
*- in this case a kind of untimely, half-drunk 3 am party-mood.*  

*With a monstrous achievement from Nicolas Bro we gape ourselves*  
*wondering through Kasimir/Ubu, who is yelling untidy words,*  
*raping dolls and playing with himself, before we reach*  
*the desillusioned end of Horwath's story - that humanity*  
*in the conditions of our society has enough to do with himself.*

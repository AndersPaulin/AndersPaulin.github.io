**KAMRATERNA**  
*by Strindberg*  
**Malmö Dramatiska Teater 1997**  

*I've always thought of Strindberg's "Comrades" as an outdated marriage quarrel, but at Intiman in Malmö Anders Paulin has made a performance that finds much more in this difficult play.*  
*He accelerates it forwards the way it's written, with all its male exaggerations, and surprisingly enough that is how he bursts through its limits. What he ends up with is an absolutely contemporary dystopia.*  
*Anders Paulin's "Comrades" is one of the most interesting re-interpretations of this season.*

**Royal Theatre, Copenhagen 2003**

Leaving the royal court of the royal theatre, the performance explored the performative aspects of letting go of privileges as a condition of autonomous subjectivity. Following the subjects in Shakespeare's play as they get lost in the forest, the performance gradually made a diasporic escape into the bars, hotels and hot dog stands of the urban landscape.

As the characters in Shakespeare's play sneak out in the woods to explore their identities beyond the frameworks of power, the actors left the audience at the Royal Theatre who now followed their adventures as a live produced video performance.

Selected to the German triennial festival Theater der Welt 2005.
(The theatre however chose to not send it.)

**FAUST**  
by Goethe  
**Malm√∂ Dramatiska Teater, 2000**

So very long ago... 
Don't quite recall what the key thematics where, besides the obvious ones:  
crossroads, selling our soul, boredom of life in capitalist growth etc  
What I however do remember is using seventeen different tracks  
of Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.  
And borrowing the dogs head from a Daft Punk video. 
And an extensive use of a low cabaret-curtain.  
And the slapstick moment when Faust and Mefisto hid in a  
bathtub filled with foam when being caught breaking in at Gretchen's place.  
And the loneliness of Mefisto at the end, when Faust choses death.

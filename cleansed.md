*Contains everything you emotionally could possibly encounter...*  
*A unique and strong expression of existence.*  
*Strikes bulls eye in the perception centre of your nervous system*

*The feeling I got when I entered that room still resides in my body.  
It was the feeling of entering a new world, a world where everything was possible.  
Here water was flushing from hoses, the walls were sprayed and painted,  
and peoples heads were forced under water until they nearly drowned.  
It was a desperation in this performance I won't forget.  
A longing that I recognized as my own. Afterwards I was left  
with questions I still haven't found the answers to.*

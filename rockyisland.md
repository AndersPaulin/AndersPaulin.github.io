*In the moment of the first one doubting.  
When uttering the first word became necessary  
the transcendent quality of nothingness  
a silent thought.  
We are vessels.  
There is Schönbergs opera.  
The story of Moses and Aaron  
we continuously produce without aim.  
Sounds and soundmachines.  
Creating conditions for the possibility  
of nonexistence.  
We are still, we listen,  
then we move, leave  
that of which we don´t know for sure  
if it has been left or if it  
has never been touched.  
Has it existed or never will?  
Drawing on our desire to be and become.  
The constant crisis of being.  
Living up to the wonder of our painful. 
wondering resolving through limiting  
our thoughts and giving purpose to  
our doing, knowing this means never to reach  
the promised land  
of understanding.*
